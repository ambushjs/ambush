Get started with Ambush by setting up the environment.

<h2>
    <a href="https://ambush.js.org/docs/getting-started/install">Installation</a>
</h2>

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14.0.0 or newer before installing by your preferred package manager ([npm](https://npmjs.com), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)).

<a href="https://npmjs.com/package/ambush">
    <img src="https://nodei.co/npm/ambush.png?mini=true" alt="npm install ambush" />
</a>

<h2>
    <a href="https://ambush.js.org/docs/getting-started/usage">Usage</a>
</h2>

You can `import` or `require()` this package by the name of your choice (preferably `ab`), or object destructure a specific module:

```js
const ab = require('ambush');
import ab from 'ambush';
```

Now, you can start implementing Ambush in your code! See all the available functions and the full documentation [here](https://ambush.js.org).

Here's a quick example merging two arrays together.

```js
const arr1 = [4, 2, 1];
const arr2 = [2, 1, 3];

ab.merge(arr1, arr2);
// => [4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3]
```

You can see that the `outputArr` array has duplicates in it. Let's try removing duplicates and sorting the array alphabetically:

```js
ab.deduplicate(outputArr);
// => [4, 2, 1, 3]

ab.sort(outputArr);
// => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
